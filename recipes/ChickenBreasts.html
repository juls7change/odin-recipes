        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Learn how to bake chicken that's tender, juicy, and perfect every time with this simple, 5-ingredient recipe for boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Adding just a bit of chicken broth to those beautiful pan drippings creates a tasty pan sauce that adds extra flavor at the table.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Boneless chicken</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Creole seasoning</li>
            <li>Chicken broth</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and sprinkle both sides with salt and Creole seasoning. Place chicken in a broiler pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip chicken and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Remove chicken to a plate.</li>
            <li>Pour chicken broth into the pan and scrape any browned bits off the bottom with a flat-edged wooden spatula. Add more broth if needed to dislodge the browned bits, but not too much or it will be watery.</li>
            <li>To serve, drizzle the pan sauce over the chicken.</li>
        </ol>
